### Purpose of Question

we have some units with a unique number, the capacity of energy that can produce and the number of intervals needs for maintaining the unit.
also, we have some intervals with a number and minimum energy that should be supplied by units.

**important point:** maintenance intervals should be behind together

### input files

our input files include two files with the name intervals.txt and units.txt

#### units.txt :

- first line includes the number of units
- every 3 lines describe a unit with this format:
- first line is the unique number of unit
- second line is the capacity of energy that unit can produce
- third line is the number of intervals that need for the maintenance unit

#### intervals.txt :

- first line includes the number of intervals
- every 2 lines describe an interval
- first line is the number of that interval
- second line is the minimum energy required for that interval

### Algorithms

we solved this question with 3 local search algorithms :


- Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm

### Libraries
 - matplotlib


- matplotlib : for showing results on a plot
